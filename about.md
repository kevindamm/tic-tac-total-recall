# About this site

This is a stub article, I still need to write it up.

## Vitepress + Vue3 + GitHub Pages

The underlying tech is pretty simple, and because the game can be defined as a
solitaire ruleset, the hosting can be done with static resources.  I can write
up how to install the required dependencies and the basic file organization.

## Drag-and-Drop within Vue3 components

HTML5 provides Drand-and-Drop functionality through the use of Javascript event
handlers and specific annotations on HTML tags.  I can describe some of that and
how it is defined within the RectCell and Card components.

## Game rules and origin

This is just a silly game I came up with, first by considering the title and
then by determining what its rules should be.
