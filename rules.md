# Game Rules (in detail)

The game is played in three phases, *Dealing*, *Revealing* and *Bidding*.  You
can optionally play without the bidding phase, in which case all cards are
revealed at once.

## First Phase: Dealing



## Second Phase: Bidding



## Third Phase: 



This game as a solitaire is simple in terms of what you need to do.  You choose
which locations on the board to deal out cards from a special deck, and if you
get any lines with "X" cards while no lines were formed with "O" cards
then you win!  If you want to play a bidding-strategy variant, you can have the
cards revealed gradually, making wagers between the reveal of each group (all
edges are shown first, then all corners and finally the center).  With 9 cards
you can infer what the final card will be, but with 10 cards it may go either way
at the final reveal, especially if you enable the game rule where it is the
dominant card (the one which appears 5 instead of 4 times) that must get a line
while not being blocked.
