# tic-tac-total-recall

An experiment in (and tech demo of) board game mechanics, using Vue3 and
interfacing with a (pseudo-)GEL, the API of Goal Expression Language currently
under development.

What if you didn't know the Tic-Tac-Toe board markers until the board is filled?

Uses card games, a grid of card surfaces, a hand (ok, it only has one card).
I'm considering a slight variant to this which gives two players five cards and
letting them choose when to play `X` or `O` or `*` face down, or choose instead
to flip a card on the board instead of placing a card, the tradeoff of information 
and action, possibly involving bluffing to convince the other player to align
their actions without knowing it, or block their progress if they guess correctly.
  I'm still refining it, but this solitaire variant is a good detour.
