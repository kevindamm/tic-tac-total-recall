# tic-tac-total-recall

An experiment in (and tech demo of) board game mechanics, using Vue3 and
interfacing with a (pseudo-)GEL, the API of Goal Expression Language currenly
under development.

What if you didn't know what the Tic-Tac-Toe board markers until the board is filled?

Uses card games, a grid of card surfaces, a hand (ok, it only has one card).

I'm considering a slight variant to this which gives two players five cards and
letting them choose when to play `X` or `O` or `*` face down, and bluff their
way to getting a line while blocking the opponent.  I'm still refining it, but
this solitaire variant is a good detour.
